# odroid-m1-archlinux
I had problems with running modern linux on my Odroid M1 device. Builds from Hardkernel were old and didn't work with my
bluetooth dongle, while others were showing only black screen and empty UART output. So, if you want something done, do it
yourself.

# Used sources


# Creating an image

## TD;DR
Just run ```bash build.sh``` to get a device-ready image with the latest ARM64 Arch linux and u-boot
and then write it to any flash drive.
